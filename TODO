BUGS & esstential functionality
* Resize
* Better connect function (taking in alternative nicks and so on)

Future Features
* Many windows
* Py interface for UI

Notes:
	Resizing the terminal is now supported, however it is not optimal.
	This is because:
		a). The signal handler calls an async_function, this is UB although
		highly unlikely to be an issue
			http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/program/signal
		b). I updates the elements by giving them new handles, this causes 
		flickering which looks bad and is slow
